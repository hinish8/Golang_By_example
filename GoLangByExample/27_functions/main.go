package main

// Func vs method
// it is clear that method has a receiver argument. A receiver can be a struct or any other type. The method will have access to the properties of the receiver and can call the receiverâ€™s other methods.
// This is the only difference between function and method, but due to it they differ in terms of functionality they offer

// A function can be used as first-order objects and can be passed around while methods cannot.
// Methods can be used for chaining on the receiver while function cannot be used for the same.
// There can exist different methods with the same name with a different receiver, but there cannot exist two different functions with the same name in the same package.

// function as a type
//In go function is also a type. Two function will be of same type if

// They have the same number of arguments with each argument is of the same type
// They have same number of return values and each return value is of same type.
