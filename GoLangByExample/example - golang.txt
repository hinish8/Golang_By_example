It is to be noted that both Marshal and MarshalIndent function can only access the exported fields of a struct, which means that only the capitalized fields can be accessed and encoded in JSON form.
JSON only allows string value for keys. So a map having an integer value for the key when converted to JSON will have a string value for the key.

A method in golang is nothing but a function with a receiver. A receiver is an instance of some specific type such as struct, but it can be an instance of any other custom type. So basically when you attach a function to a type, then that function becomes a method for that type. The method will have access to the properties of the receiver and can call the receiverâ€™s other methods.

The receiver type has to be defined in the same package as the method definition. On defining a method on a receiver that exists in a different package, below error will be raised.

Array are value type in go. So an array variable name is not a pointer to the first element in fact it denotes the entire array. A copy of the array will be created when

An array variable is assigned to another array variable.
An array variable is passed as an argument to a function.

With that said the thought that might be coming to your mind is whether it is possible to have different lengths for inner slices. Yes, it is possible. Unlike arrays which have inner arrays of the same length, in case of slice since we initialize each of the inner slices individually, it is possible to have different length for inner slices
